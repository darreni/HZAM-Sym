# HZAM-Sym
The Hybrid Zone with Assortative Mating model, in full sympatry with ecological differentiation (HZAM-Sym)

This repository contains the R code used in this manuscript:

Irwin, D., and Schluter, D. 2021. Hybridization and the coexistence of species. bioRxiv.

The code for running HZAM-Sym simulations and the code for making the figures in the paper are both included in this file: HZAM-Sym_release_1.0.R

The R code was written by Darren Irwin. You are welcome to use these scripts; if you do, please site the paper above (and perhaps also this GitHub repository).

To produce the paper figures, the data files are needed, and these are too big for Github. They will be included in a Dryad archive, after the paper is submitted to a journal.

I welcome questions and comments: irwin@zoology.ubc.ca
